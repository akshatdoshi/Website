  <b> 1) Introduction to Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) </b>
  <p> Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress towards human-level AI. In this class, you will learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting them to work for yourself. More importantly, you'll learn about not only the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new problems. Finally, you'll learn about some of Silicon Valley's best practices in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI. </p>
  <p> This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.</p>
  <p> I recommend this course because this course is perfect if you are a beginner in Machine Learning and would like to get some gentle yet thorough exposure to the field.
<p>Professor Ng is an enthusiastic teacher who presents the material in a very accessible fashion. He doesn't get too deep into mathematics but teaches you enough to get a sense for what exactly a learning algorithm is doing under the hood. The professor Andrew ng is very good professor he teaches this course in Stanford university and he is one of the lead research scientist at google. </p>
<p>This course covers mostly all of the aspects of machine learning like supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Assignments and projects of this course is also very amazing and industry oriented. so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas. </p>
<b>2) Udacity Nanodegree Program in AI and ML (https://www.udacity.com/school-of-ai) </b>
<p> Udacity courses are of very high quality but often jump straight into high-level projects. A great way to learn but very difficult if you don’t have foundation knowledge. </p>
<p>If you already have some foundational knowledge of deep learning and machine learning or are a solid Python programmer already, Udacity’s AI Nanodegree may be the ideal place for you to start. </p>
<p>The Udacity course is taught at a much higher level, and the assignments are much more complex and open-ended, with little or no guidance to help you get to the right answer. I thought the lectures were a hodgepodge of topics, from many different presenters, with no clear master plan, and with inconsistent quality. You do, however, get access to real people to help when you are stuck. You solve real research problems in this course sequence, using python and tensorflow. And, you get to see and experiment with a good cross-section of different deep learning network architectures. You need to be well-skilled in python, pandas, numpy, etc to succeed, but the tensorflow stuff is taught as part of the course. This nanodegree foundation sequence was difficult and often very frustrating. However, at the end of the day, I feel like I emerged with the skills needed to be capable of really solving actual, real-world problems. </p>
<p>So, my very strong recommendation is to do both, starting with Andrew Ng's course and only then tackling the Udacity sequence.
